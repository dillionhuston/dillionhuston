## 🧠 About Me

I'm a backend-focused developer building secure, fast, and testable systems using Python.  
Currently working on backend tools, schedulers, and encrypted file systems with real deployments.

Learning more about networking and cybersecurity to sharpen my systems-level understanding.  
I push updates almost daily and build everything with clean code, logs, type hints, and tests.

## 🔨 What I Work With

**Languages**  
Python, Bash, C# (learning), Dart (learning)

**Frameworks & Tools**  
FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Docker, Redis, pytest, Git, SQLite/Postgres

**Focus Areas**  
- REST APIs  
- File storage + AES encryption  
- JWT authentication  
- Task scheduling & background jobs  
- Logging + exception handling  
- Testing and deployment  
- Networking tools, routing, scanning

## 🚀 Projects

### [📅 Task Scheduler API (Main Project)](https://github.com/dillionhuston/Task-Automation-API)

A backend-only FastAPI project that schedules tasks with full auth, logging, file validation, and background workers.  
Made to be clean, efficient, and production-ready.

**Features:**
- FastAPI + Celery + Redis integration  
- JWT auth system (login/register)  
- File upload with SHA-256 validation  
- Centralized logging + custom exceptions  
- TaskType and TaskStatus enums  
- Full `pytest` test suite  
- Dockerized + ready to deploy  
- Clean routes, docstrings, type hints throughout

### [🔐 Encrypted File Storage – "Shadow"](https://github.com/dillionhuston/Shadow)

Flask API for AES-256 encrypted file upload/download. Built from scratch with role-based access and secure design.

**Highlights:**
- AES-256 encryption  
- JWT-based user & admin roles  
- RESTful endpoints  
- SHA-256 file validation  
- Deployment-ready with Docker  
- Unit tested with `pytest`

---

### 🧪 Tools, Prototypes, and Scripts

- Port scanner and IP tools using Python sockets  
- Terminal-based file viewer for trust fund data  
- Image-to-text converter using Tesseract  
- Custom file hashing tool (SHA256)  
- Bash + Python hybrid scripts for automation

---

## 📚 Learning Now

- Kubernetes and container orchestration  
- C# for system/backend work  
- Dart & Flutter for cross-platform utilities  
- Advanced networking: subnetting, TCP/IP, scanning  
- Backend scaling patterns & job queues
